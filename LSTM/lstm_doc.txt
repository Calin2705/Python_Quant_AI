Adadelta:  Another adaptive learning rate method. Less dependent on the choice of initial learning rate than RMSprop.

Pros: Good for noisy or rapidly changing data.
Cons: Slightly slower convergence compared to Adam in some cases.

When Alternatives Might Be Preferred

Strong Stationarity: If your time series is very strictly stationary (consistent mean and variance), simpler optimizers like SGD or RMSprop might be sufficient and potentially slightly faster.
Proven Success of Adam: Adam is often a very successful optimizer for LSTMs. If Adam works well for your application, there may be less reason to switch.
Memory Constraints: Adadelta stores past gradients and updates, which can increase memory usage compared to simpler optimizers.
